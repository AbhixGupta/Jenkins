# Jenkins

Jenkins is a Java-based open-source automation tool with built-in continuous integration plugins. Jenkins is used to continuously build and test your software projects, making it simpler for developers to incorporate changes to the project and for users to get a new build. By integrating with a wide range of testing and deployment technologies, it also enables you to deliver your software continuously.

Organizations can use Jenkins to automate and speed up the software development process. Jenkins combines all stages of the development lifecycle, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy, static analysis, and many others.

Plugins assist Jenkins in achieving Continuous Integration. DevOps stages can be integrated thanks to plugins. Installing the utility's plugins is necessary if you want to incorporate that tool. Git, Maven 2 projects, Amazon EC2, HTML publishers, etc. are a few examples.
